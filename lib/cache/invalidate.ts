/**
 * Applies an invalidation plan. Call it from a Server Action or a Route
 * Handler only: revalidateTag and revalidatePath do not work in Client
 * Components or the proxy. Await it before returning the action's result.
 *
 * Order matters. cached.ts's Redis read-through layer is purged first (a new
 * generation per tag), and only then are the Next tags and paths revalidated.
 * Revalidating first would let a regeneration that starts in between read the
 * pre-purge Redis value and write it back into the data cache for a full
 * revalidate window. The purge is one parallel Redis round trip; a failed
 * purge is logged and the Next revalidation still runs. The wait is bounded:
 * every Upstash call goes through FailoverKv (lib/cache/redis.ts), which
 * times out after 1.5 s and fails over to memory, so a hung request cannot
 * hold a save open.
 *
 * Tags use the "max" profile (stale-while-revalidate): the old page keeps being
 * served while the new one builds, so a database blip during regeneration never
 * blanks the public site. `{ expire: 0 }` is deliberately not used for public
 * tags (docs/plan/admin-cms-adr.md, section 5.1 and R16).
